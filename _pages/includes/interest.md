# Research Interests
I work in the field of time series analysis, multi-modal foundation model, large language model, and federated learning, primarily investigating the development and application of advanced deep learning techniques to solve key problems in the digital transformation of energy:
- Time-Series Analysis (foundation models, forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, etc.)
- Multi-Modal Learning and Alignment (image, text, time-series, video, etc.)
- Large Language Models (fine-tuning, preference optimization, applications, etc.)
- Federated Learning (distributed learning, privacy protection, etc.)
