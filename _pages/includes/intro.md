I work at the Digital Research Institute of ENN Group <img src='./images/enngroup.png' style='width: 5em;'> as an AI Engineer now in Beijing, China. 

Digital Research Institute of ENN Group is committed to the research and development of industrial digitalization and artificial intelligence technology innovation, for smart energy, supply chains, smart cities, healthy lifestyles, etc. In recent years, the Institute has focused on federated learning and foundation models for industrial applications, with fruitful R&D results, more than 400 invention patents applied, dozens of impactful papers published with top conference awards, and several technical standards released.

As an AI engineer, my primary responsibilities include researching industrial internet, time series analysis, multi-modal foundation models, knowledge distillation, and federated learning. I have successfully deployed a series of projects in various applications such as natural gas demand forecasting, equipment predictive maintenance, heating system optimization, and safety inspection and management. We establish collaborations amongst government agencies, industry companies and universities for fundamental research, interoperable Federated Learning platform testbed and ecosystem for various Industrial Internet applications with many participants from different backgrounds and regions.

I won the [Baidu Scholarship](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E5%A5%96%E5%AD%A6%E9%87%91/9929412) (10 candidates worldwide each year) and [ByteDance Scholars Program](https://ur.bytedance.com/scholarship) (10 candidates worldwide each year) in 2020 and was selected as one of [the top 100 AI Chinese new stars](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4NzQ5MTA2NA==&mid=2653639431&idx=1&sn=25b6368c1954419b9090840347d9a27d&chksm=8be75b90bc90d286a5af3ef8e610e822d705dc3cf4382b45e3f14489f3e7ec4fd8c95ed0eceb&mpshare=1&scene=2&srcid=0511LMlj9Qv9DeIZAjMjYAU9&sharer_sharetime=1620731348139&sharer_shareid=631c113940cb81f34895aa25ab14422a#rd) and AI Chinese New Star Outstanding Scholar (10 candidates worldwide each year). 

My research interest includes time-series analysis(forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection), fault diagnosis, large language model, federated learning, ensemble learning, and granular computing. I have published 50+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4FA6C0AAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD. 

To promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, we (along with other 11 young scholars worldwide) founded the [MLNLP community](https://space.bilibili.com/168887299) in 2021. I am honored to be one of the chairs of the MLNLP committee.
